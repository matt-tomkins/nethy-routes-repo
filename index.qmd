## Overview

Routes are categorised according to whether they can be completed [from the hut](hut.qmd) or require [club transport](transport.qmd).

This is not an exhaustive list of all routes that have been completed on previous Nethys, but a selection of the most popular. 

For each route, there is information on: 

- approximate difficulty (easy / medium / hard)
- length
- ascent 
- start location
- the intended route (minimal detail)

A GPX download for each route is also provided. These are listed in full [here](gpx.qmd).

## Safety

When deciding on your route, remember to consider:

- the [weather](https://www.mwis.org.uk/forecasts/scottish/cairngorms-np-and-monadhliath) conditions
- the snow conditions, both in terms of the difficulty of movement and navigation, but also the risk of [avalanche](https://www.sais.gov.uk/northern-cairngorms/)
- the experience and fitness of your group
- what equipment might be needed (crampons, ice axes, group shelter, headtorches, first-aid kit *etc*)
- the daylight hours available.
